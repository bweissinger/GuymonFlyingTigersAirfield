# Wind Analysis and Runway Optimization for Model Aircraft Flying Site

My local model airfield, Lear Field, in Guymon, Oklahoma is 
considering adding two additional runways. This project uses one-minute ASOS data to investigate local wind patterns and determine optimum runway placement.

Data files are not included due to GitHub file size limitations. However, the notebook includes automated downloading.
